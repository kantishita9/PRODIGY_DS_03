# Project 3 - Decision Tree Classifier #

![Task 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c1ea9fe-3b25-47d6-8477-8dbd0b76a011)

This project is a part of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. It demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using Python and scikit-learn to perform supervised machine learning tasks on a sample dataset.

 # Decision Tree Classifier : Overview
 Develop and train a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict outcomes based on labeled input data. The goal is to understand how decision trees work for classification problems and evaluate their performance using accuracy metrics and visualizations.
 
# Dataset #

The dataset used for this project is [bank-additional.csv](bank-additional.csv)
